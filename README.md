# SonicDB

SonicDB for flutter is a database library that inspired by the Room database for android.
even though it's rarely get updates but it still under active development.

the code is still chaotic right now so you'll find some code that is commented out or maybe a print method here and there because this library was made by trial and error, the generated code is unpredictable and the library i use is very lacking in documentation plus i was still in early stage of learning flutter and dart when i made this. 
But you can use this in your app, i have an app that already use this [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixaline.varity).
